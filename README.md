# Close Tabs to the Right

A fork of [mkopec/close-tabs-to-the-left](https://github.com/mkopec/close-tabs-to-the-left)

With Firefox 78, the "Close other tabs" and "Close tabs to the right" options where moved to a submenu in the browser tabs context menu. This WebExtension adds a context menu option to browser tabs to close tabs to the right of the selected one.

Tested on Firefox 78.
