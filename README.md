# Close Tabs to the Right

A fork of [mkopec/close-tabs-to-the-left](https://github.com/mkopec/close-tabs-to-the-left)

With Firefox 78, the "Close other tabs" and "Close tabs to the right" options where moved to a submenu in the browser tabs context menu. This WebExtension adds a context menu option to browser tabs to close tabs to the right of the selected one.

I've translated what locales I can, but some of the included languages are way beyond me. I've opted to keep then even though they still say "Close tabas to the left" in the hopes of some kind soul helping out with a PR or three. ;)

Tested on Firefox 78.
